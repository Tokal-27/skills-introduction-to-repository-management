1. **Do not** create an issue, disclose the vulnerability publicly, or discuss it with others.
2. In the top navigation, go to the **Security** tab.
3. Click the **Report a vulnerability** button.
4. Complete the form, including:
   - Description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce it
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (optional)
5. Email the IT Club advisor at **techsupport@mergingtonhigh.example.edu** to notify them â€” but do **not** include sensitive info.

## Response Timeline

- Acknowledge receipt: **within 2 school days**
- Initial assessment: **within 5 school days**
- Critical student data issues: **fixed immediately**
- A private fork may be created to fix the issue with your collaboration.
